To frame the task, throughout our practical applications, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM.  This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.  Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM [here](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip).  After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

### Business Understanding

From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.

**The business objective:** to understand what factors make the car less or more expensive so that we can inform our client as a used car dealership to what consumers value in a used car.
